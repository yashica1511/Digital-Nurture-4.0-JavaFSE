## 📐 What is Asymptotic Notation?

**Asymptotic Notation** (e.g., Big O) is used to describe the time complexity of algorithms. It helps understand the growth of an algorithm’s execution time based on input size.

### 🔎 Search Complexity Comparison

| Algorithm       | Best Case | Average Case | Worst Case |
|----------------|-----------|--------------|------------|
| Linear Search   | O(1)      | O(n)         | O(n)       |
| Binary Search   | O(1)      | O(log n)     | O(log n)   |
